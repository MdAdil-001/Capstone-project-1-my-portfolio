    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Gym & Powerlifting</h2>
<p>The gym is my temple, and powerlifting is my ritual. There’s something sacred about the grind—the weight on my shoulders, the silence before a lift, the roar of victory when I push past my limits. It’s not just about building muscle; it’s about building character. Every rep teaches me patience, every failure teaches me resilience.</p>
<h2>Reading Urdu Literature</h2>
<p>I lose myself in the elegance of Urdu, where every word feels like a sigh and every verse carries centuries of emotion. Jaun Elia is my muse—his melancholy, his rebellion, his unapologetic honesty. When I read his poetry, I feel seen. Urdu literature isn’t just a hobby for me; it’s a mirror to my soul.</p>
<h2>Riding Bikes</h2>
<p>There’s a thrill in the throttle, a freedom in the wind. Riding clears my mind like nothing else. Whether I’m weaving through city streets or chasing horizons, the road reminds me that life is meant to be felt in motion. My bike isn’t just a machine—it’s my companion in solitude and adventure.</p>
<h2>Talking to New People</h2>
<p>I love the spark of a new conversation—the way stories unfold, the way strangers become friends. Every person I meet adds a new color to my world. I ask questions, I listen deeply, and I learn something every time. For me, connection is the most underrated form of wisdom.</p>
<h2>Trying New Recipes</h2>
<p>I’m always chasing flavor. I find joy in experimenting—mixing spices, flipping techniques, and discovering combinations that surprise me. Cooking new recipes is like solving delicious puzzles. It’s where my creativity meets my curiosity, and the reward is always edible.</p>.
